This program is an extract from my executable program


Consider this as a framework and use your own file / data / query etc to fill the missing places and use it to help find the optimal read TPS basis your


1. Data Size

2. Disk type - HDD / SSD etc

3. Ongoing writes

4. Prevailing compaction load


This when you know your optimal read performance, you can decide whether to add more nodes, change disk, reduce writes, change compaction strategy etc etc
